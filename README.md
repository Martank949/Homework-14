## Description of my Project:

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

I built the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the starter code. I worked with Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

## Usage Story

AS A slave at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT the company that owns me can compete their other e-commerce companies
