## Description of my Project:

### Homework-14

The Model is the data layer of the application. It is concerned with the structure of the database and the logic used to retrieve that data. I implemented Sequelize as the ORM for querying the database.
Last but not least is the Controller. Think of it as the intermediary between the View and the Model. The Controller handles input from the user, interacts with the Model to create, read, update, or delete data, and then returns the results of that query to the user via the View layer. While using Express.js apps, we'll separate the client-side and server-side routes from each other.
